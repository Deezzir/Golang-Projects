# Golang Projects

The repository contains **3** projects that I built as a part of learning `Go` language. It was an interesting experience and I really liked the language and its features.

### Resository Structure

- `reps-crud`  - a folder with simple Repository CRUD API that picks the data from the mock_data.json file (using [Mux](github.com/gorilla/mux) Router)
